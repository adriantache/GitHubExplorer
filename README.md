# GitHubExplorer
Explore repositories and download files

This is a simple app that is a slight refinement of what I did for a coding test. It allows you to see a user's repository (with login and 2FA) and navigate through and access the file structure.

For a proper app to explore GitHub, try https://github.com/k0shk0sh/FastHub
